What Are Data Structures:-

->data stuctures:storing a data in a differnt way.
ex.we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.

Algorithm:-

->Well-defined sequence of steps to solve a problem.
->Procedure for solving a problem, with special focus on solving problems 
using a computer.
ex.There are two type of algo Searching and shoring

Arry:-
we can say like one box has manay particions is called an arry.
->if we lost a data we can eazyly find the data with arry.


link list:-

->storeing a collection of items.
->it is devided in to many boxes and each box has different data and link to the other box.
->box can contain eany datatype.
->head is the first data.
->end box of next is alwas null in sigali list.
->dynamic 
ex
Previous and next page in web browser â€“ We can access previous and next url searched in web browser by pressing back and next button since, they are linked as linked list.

An Overview of Arrays and Memory:-

->memory:-it is temp data storage.
long tape of data.

->storage:-it is permenent data storage.

Class:-
->Class is a user-defined datatype that contain its own data members and member functions.
->The member functions and data members can be accessed with the help of objects.

ex.class Dog{
	public member
	privat member
};

Object:-
->Is a collection of var and funtions.
->Object can be created many times as per requirement.

ex.class Car{
	int no=5;

	public static void main(String[] args)
	Car BMW =new Car();
	System.out.println(BMW.no);
}

constuctor:-
->is it like an method.
two type:
1.default
class Car{
Car(){
	System.out.println("BMW");
}
public static void main(String args[])
{
	Car b=new Car();
}
}
}
2.paramitrie

Big O notetion:-
->the notetion o(n) is the formal/mathemetical way to express the worst caseof the algo running time.

recursion:-
->a way of slolving the pro by haveing a function it's self
